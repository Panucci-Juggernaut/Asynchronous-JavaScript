# Asynchronous JavaScript Examples

This repository demonstrates different approaches to handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, focusing on making HTTP requests and handling JSON data.

## Contents

The file includes examples of:

1. Basic XMLHttpRequest with callbacks
2. Callback hell example (nested callbacks)
3. Promise-based implementation
4. Promise chaining
5. Fetch API usage
6. Async/await implementation

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Local server for running the examples (due to CORS policy when fetching local JSON files)

## Notes

- Examples demonstrate the evolution from callback-based code to modern async/await syntax
- Each implementation shows proper error handling
- The code includes comments explaining different asynchronous patterns
